Get an API key from https://www.dropbox.com/developers to
configure Nightlies.php for $consumerKey and $consumerSecret

Set up a Memcache server (localhost or somewhere firewalled)
and set the address in memcache.php

Try not to pass my e-mail address to strangers on index.html

Remember to set the full path to your system deployment root
in nightlies_regen, to allow the background cache process to
operate asynchronously.  Set it also in user.php to the user
database location, which should be under your deployment root
in db/ (so, in my case /var/www/nightlies-with/db/users.sq3)


Review the necessary changes since "initial commit" on GitHub
(Only configuration steps are shown in the revision history)
These steps should be explained clearly by the wording above!
