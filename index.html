   <h2>Connect your Dropbox to the Android-x86 Nightlies tool!</h2>
   <h4>Hungry for content?
      <a href="nightlies.php">Go straight to the index</a></h4>
   <p><b>Step 0:</b> No Dropbox account?
      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/##############">use my referral link</a> to sign up for an account, and we will each get a 256MB bonus!</p>
   <p><b>Step 1:</b> log in with Dropbox:
   <a href="oauth_workflow.php">oauth workflow</a>; here, you can authorize the
   Nightlies Dropbox Tool to access the files in your Dropbox.  Only files in
   <code>Public/android-x86/</code> will be catalogged by this application.
   You can still maintain personal files in the Dropbox root or in other
   folders.  Once you have authorized this application, you will not need to
   use your login credentials again.</p>
   
   <p><b>Step 2:</b> organize your builds in <code>Public/android-x86/</code>;
   make it a public folder, and let the files that you want to share
   synchronize with Dropbox.  Other site users will be able to view and rate
   your builds.  The highest rated builds will be promoted onto the mirror site
   <a href="http://martyfunkhouser.csh.rit.edu/~yebyen/">martyfunkhouser</a>,
   where there is no rate limiting or bandwidth usage cap.</p>
   <p>We have about 5GB of space for promoted builds and server overhead, which
   is free for our excellent example of non-profit use, thanks to the awesome
   <a href="https://github.com/ComputerScienceHouse/xmc">Xen Cloud</a> of 
   <a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/">Computer Science House</a> at the
   <a href="http://www.rit.edu/">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>.</p>

   <p><b>Step 3:</b> promote the Nightlies Dropbox Tool to your Android-x86
   friends so they can vote for your uploads and review your builds or android
   apps!  You are welcomed to donate your cpu time with a nightly build cron
   job to provide nightlies for your favorite <code>TARGET_PRODUCT</code>.  You
   can even use this site as a way to promote your own original content.</p>
   
   <h4>Good Ideas and Legaleze</h4>
   <p>You can post anything from full builds of
   <a href="http://android-x86.org">Android-x86</a> that you made with
   <code>repo</code> and <code>lunch</code>, apk's for your own projects, or
   tarballs of your own app sources.</p>

   <p style="text-align: center; border: 2px dashed black;"><b>(Do obey
      copyright, unusual uploads without clear licensing will not be
      promoted.)</b><br/>
   Android-x86 is a GPL derivative work of AOSP and can be shared freely, so
   long as you provide source for any customizations you have made.<br/>
   <em>You are responsible for your own Dropbox content!</em></p>

   <p>Links to the files that you have made public are automatically promoted
   on the index once you connect your Dropbox account with this application,
   and copies of files will only be promoted to the mirror after they have been
   reviewed by a site admin.</p>
   <p>We cannot be held responsible for illegal content that you provide
   (illegal files will not be promoted), and users who abuse the service in
   this way will be terminated, banned from contributing to the index, and
   probably also banned from the Dropbox community for violation of terms of
   service.</p>

   <p>Now that you understand the rules,
   <b><a href="nightlies.php">check out the index</a></b>!<br/>
